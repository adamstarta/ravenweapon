      GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF BUSINESS
    </h1>

    <!-- AGB Content -->
    <div class="agb-content">
      <h2>1. Reservation/Order</h2>
      <p>
        A deposit of 20% of the sales price is required to order or reserve goods. The deposit must be paid within 48 hours; otherwise, the goods will be released for sale again. If the reservation or order is cancelled by the customer, we reserve the right to retain the 20% deposit as compensation.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Cancellation Policy / Returns</h2>
      <p>
        You can cancel your contract within 14 days by sending a written notice via email, stating your reasons. The cancellation period begins after receipt of your order or placement of the order. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient to send the cancellation notice before the deadline expires. The cancellation notice should be sent to the following address:
      </p>

      <address>
        <strong>Raven Weapon AG</strong><br>
        Sunnenbergstrasse 2<br>
        8633 Wolfhausen
      </address>

      <p>
        The right of withdrawal applies only to goods available in the online shop. Goods specifically ordered at the customer's request are not subject to the right of withdrawal.
      </p>

      <h3>2.1 Consequences of the revocation</h3>
      <p>
        Exercising your right of withdrawal transforms the purchase agreement into a reversal transaction, whereby any payments received under the purchase agreement must be refunded. Received goods must be returned no later than 14 days after you declare your withdrawal. We will also refund any payments received within 14 days of you declaring your withdrawal. However, we may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have provided proof that you have returned them, whichever is earlier.
      </p>

      <p>Please note that we do not offer a right of withdrawal for the following products:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Returns of used items.</li>
        <li>Items without or with damaged original packaging.</li>
        <li>Transport damage (according to paragraph 2.2).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In the case of an unjustified return, this should also be noted briefly. You are responsible for the return shipping costs. We reserve the right to deduct compensation for any damage or excessive wear and tear from the refundable purchase price if the loss in value is due to handling of the goods beyond what is necessary to ascertain their nature, characteristics, and functioning.
      </p>

      <p>Should a shipment be returned to us for the following reasons, the order will be automatically cancelled after notification to the customer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The package was not picked up.</li>
        <li>Recipient unknown.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In special cases, it is possible to resend the package; however, a flat fee of CHF 10.00 will be charged for this.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Damage or loss</h3>
      <p><strong>Did your order arrive damaged? (Postal Service)</strong></p>
      <p>
        If your shipment arrives damaged, please take the damaged product, along with its outer packaging and packing material, immediately to your local post office and fill out a damage report. Request a copy and send it to us as a photo or scan to <a href="mailto:info@ravenweapon.ch" class="text-yellow-600 hover:underline">info@ravenweapon.ch</a> so that you can claim your right to undamaged goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Damage that is not externally visible must be reported to the responsible post office in your municipality within 14 days of delivery.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Have you not received your order? (Post)</strong></p>
      <p>
        If the shipment does not arrive within 5 days of receiving the shipping confirmation, it is the customer's responsibility to notify us immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Shipping</h2>
      <p>
        We generally ship via Swiss Post or DPD. Shipping costs are calculated according to the current rates of the respective providers.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Offer</h2>
      <p>All items are available according to the availability indicator on the product pages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Available:</strong> Item ready for immediate dispatch, delivery time 1-3 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Available from supplier:</strong> Item is in transit, exact delivery date is not yet known.</li>
        <li><strong>On request:</strong> This item is currently unavailable and cannot be ordered. Inquiries can be made at any time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Optical variations from the product images are possible.</p>

      <h2>5. Payments and deliveries</h2>
      <p>
        The final price of your order includes VAT, plus the stated shipping costs. Your items will generally be shipped immediately after payment has been credited to our account. Claims for damages due to delay, impossibility of performance, or non-performance are excluded.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Retention of title</h2>
      <p>
        In contracts with consumers, the goods remain our property until the purchase price has been paid in full. In contracts with businesses, the seller retains title to the goods until all claims arising from the ongoing business relationship have been settled.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Warranty / Guarantee</h2>
      <p>
        We guarantee that the goods are free from material and manufacturing defects at the time of transfer of risk and possess the contractually agreed-upon characteristics. Any visible defects must be reported to us in writing within 7 working days. The warranty period is 24 months.
      </p>
      <p>
        The warranty does not cover normal wear and tear. It is void if the customer modifies the delivered goods.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Conclusion of the contract</h2>
      <p>
        The presentation of products in the online shop does not constitute a legally binding offer, but merely a non-binding online catalog.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Debt collection</h2>
      <p>Costs incurred due to late payment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Late payment fee of CHF 30 each (after 50, 70 and 90 days from the invoice date).</li>
        <li>Processing fee depends on the amount claimed.</li>
      </ul>
